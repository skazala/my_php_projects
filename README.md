# my_php_projects
This repository contains small projects which I write as I learn PHP language.

- world_traveller.php

Hello there, friend! We’re exhausted having just returned to New York City from a whirlwind of world travel. 
We’re bringing all our international currency to the bank to be exchanged for USD. 
Our travels have made us wise and weary, and we want to ensure we’re being treated fairly.

This project calculates exactly how much cash in USD we should end up with after it has all been exchanged.

- mad_lib_functions.php

In this project I use PHP to write a function to fill in a Mad Libs story! 
Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces, which get filled in by the user.
The result is usually funny (or strange).

- bobs_budget.php

This project uses arrays and calculates annual amount of money that Bob can save on his new job.

- bobby_tables.php

This project collects the user’s name, character, email and birth year from the input form.
It also sanitizes and validates the data.

- repetitive_cafe.php

This project uses different types of loops with HTML to create the cafe's menu.

- fizz_buzz.php

This project prints the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive), except for these cases:
* If a number is a multiple of 3, it prints "Fizz".
* If a number is a multiple of 5, it prints "Buzz".
* If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

- number_guessing.php

In this project is a number guessing game. It generates a random number between 1 and 10. 
You’ll run the game 10 times and get some information about your guessing abilities.

- magic8ball.php

In this project, I wrote a function that can answer any “yes” or “no” question.
