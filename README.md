# my_php_projects
This repository contains small projects which I write as I learn PHP language.

- world_traveller.php

Hello there, friend! We’re exhausted having just returned to New York City from a whirlwind of world travel. 
We’re bringing all our international currency to the bank to be exchanged for USD. 
Our travels have made us wise and weary, and we want to ensure we’re being treated fairly.

This project calculates exactly how much cash in USD we should end up with after it has all been exchanged.

- mad_lib_functions.php

In this project I use PHP to write a function to fill in a Mad Libs story! 
Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces, which get filled in by the user.
The result is usually funny (or strange).

- bobs_budget.php

This project uses arrays and calculates annual amount of money that Bob can save on his new job.
